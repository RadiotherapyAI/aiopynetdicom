# aiopynetdicom

This is some example code on how one might go about wrapping `pynetdicom`
within `asyncio`.

To install with pip:

```bash
pip install .
```

To run use the installed command line interface:

```bash
aiopynetdicom
```

Then, utilise a separate pynetdicom instance to send C Store requests.
